# Moog Ladder Filter in Odin
A port to Odin of an Moog Ladder Filter math model, with a port also of a modified real time audio example in RayLib with to demo it.

## Description
Moog ladder filter implementation writtern in Odin to approximate the SP-1200's SSM2044. <br>

This is a port of a mathematical model of the iconic analog circuit of a Moog Ladder Filter, from the following repository in python. <br>

GitHub mwcm - MoogFilter <br>
[https://github.com/mwcm/MoogFilter](https://github.com/mwcm/MoogFilter) <br>

Based on the [Improved Model](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/MoogLadders/blob/master/src/ImprovedModel.h) from [ddiakopoulos](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos)' [MoogLadders](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/MoogLadders) repo.

The Improved Model itself was created by D'Angelo & Valimaki in 2013's ["An Improved Virtual Analog Model of the Moog Ladder Filter"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddiakopoulos/MoogLadders/master/research/DAngeloValimaki.pdf)


## Realtime audio GUI
To demo the Moog Ladder Filter, I also ported an example of a Audio GUI from RayLib in C to Odin. Then modified it, so it could demo the Moog Ladder Filter. This is an example that came directly from the site of the RayLib Audio examples. <br>
